---># Advanced HTML Encoder/Decoder

## Overview
The Advanced HTML Encoder/Decoder is a Node.js application designed to encode and decode HTML content using various obfuscation techniques. This tool utilizes Base64 encoding combined with a basic XOR cipher to enhance the security of the encoded content. It is intended for educational and security analysis purposes.

## Features
- **Base64 Encoding**: Converts HTML content into a Base64 encoded string.
- **XOR Cipher**: Applies a simple XOR cipher for additional obfuscation.
- **Logging**: Keeps track of all analyses with timestamps in a log file.
- **Command Line Interface**: Easy to use via the command line.

## Installation Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/html-encoder-decoder.git
   cd html-encoder-decoder
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create the logs directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir logs
   ```

## Usage Instructions
1. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   node src/encoderDecoder.js
   ```

2. **Follow the prompts** to either encode or decode HTML content.

3. **View logs**: All analyses will be logged in the `logs/analysis.log` file.

## Important Considerations
- **Ethical Use**: This tool is intended for educational and security analysis purposes only. Ensure that you have permission to analyze any HTML content.
- **Security**: The XOR cipher used in this tool is basic and should not be relied upon for securing sensitive data. For stronger encryption, consider using established libraries like CryptoJS or the Web Crypto API.
